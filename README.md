### My Personal Blog Website

This is the code for my personal blog website. It uses the Python Flask framework (as most of my basic projects do). It has a section in the website in which the owner can use their password to gain access to a post writing section, so posts are dynamically made from the page.

It is a single page application, so once loaded, has no extra loading time. This is the first time I have done this, and I did it without a framework built for that purpose, I quite like the result.

I also decided to give the website a darker, 'chic' look, with a red highlight to eccentuate certain elements. As a whole, I am glad with how the website turned out and I am excited to update it wtih blog posts for (hopefully) years to come.

### What I Learnt

For the first time, I have added a search bar. The search bar is very basic, but I liked making it, and I am glad with how effective it is. I learnt how to dynamically receive a query and search through elements for corresponding posts.
